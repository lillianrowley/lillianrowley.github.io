Hi there, I'm Lilly!
====================

I love wolves, candy, making my website, Minecraft, my hoverboard, and adorable puppies, and hope *you* love this website! I made it especially for kids, so if you are a parent snooping around it, it might not be as fun as it is for your kids

About This Website
==================

Soon, I will make a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game [Here](/game/start). I am not a professional or anything, so it may not be as fun as some other ones, with makers that get payed to make good websites.

You can also check out some of my pictures and videos!

My latest project is a podcast about the game Wanderhome. You can listen to it
[Here](/podcast) or on any podcasting app through the rss feed
[Here](/podcast/feed.xml).

This website is under construction!
-----------------------------------

I am just starting to make it, so it may be even more awesome in the future! I am almost done with the choose your own adventure, so soon I will start working on the other one. I have some games that I made on scratch, too. (They open in a new tab)
