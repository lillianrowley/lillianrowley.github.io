Tales from the Haeth Podcast
============================

A podcast which shares tales from our playing of the tabletop role-playing game Wanderhome.

Lilly Rowley and her family love to play the tabletop role-playing game Wanderhome. In this game, all the player characters are journeying animal folk, who live in a peaceful and bucolic land called the Haeth.

As they travel, the players meet new kith and explore new places. Sometimes they are surrounded by mystery and magic, while other times they face mundane and quotidian struggles with a relatable real-life feel. The story can explore topics like trauma, rejection, rebirth, and identity. Or it can take a more gentle road, remaining cheery annd more focused on the magic surrounding us. Everything in the Haeth breathes with life, and even nature can act in your stories through locations and seasons.

Join Val, Isaac, Coz, Spotty, and Enchantment on their journey to find their perfect home.
