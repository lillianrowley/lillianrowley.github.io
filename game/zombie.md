![A scary zombie!](/game/images/Zombie.jpg){: style="float:right"}

You see some rattling junk ahead. A zombie emerges from the junk and comes toward you!

You look around for a weapon, but all you see is a torch on the wall. You are also wearing a shoe, I guess.

What will you use for a weapon as you fight the zombie?
