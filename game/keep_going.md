You happen to have a thing called a "relay," (ultimate waterproof edition) which is kind of like a phone except you can't play games on it or anything. Bummer. But at least your mom can call you if it's time for you to go home. So, you keep on going. 

It keeps getting darker and darker. You figure that the sun is going down, but pretty soon the shimmers disappear. I guess it's time to go home now. We can figure out what that was later.

The End!
