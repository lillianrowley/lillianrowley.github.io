When you follow the dolphin to the palace, you find that there is a big gate blocking you. You try to open it, but it won't open!

There's not a lock, though, so it must just be jammed. You think you might just have to go home and solve this mystery another day, but you find that the dolphin has a key in its mouth. Why does it have that!? It doesn't need it, the gate has no lock.

The dolphin swims closer, then swims away and dissapears in a flash! 

Do you follow the dolphin, or go back home?
