The ghost says "ooooooooooooooohnooooooooooooo!"

You say "Are you talking like 'No, I'm not evil,' or are you talking like 'I want to play Uno'?"

"Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuunoooooooooooooo" said the ghost.

You say "Huh, well, this is a closet, we can probably find Uno somewhere"

So, you and the ghost look for *Uno* for five hours and six minutes and finally find it! Then, you play Uno for the rest of the night. The ghost is very good; You get beaten five times. You are very good; The ghost gets beaten six times.
