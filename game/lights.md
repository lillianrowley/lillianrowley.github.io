You are so fascinated with the lights, you don't care that it's 5 hours past midnight! You follow the lights and finally they stop again.

You take a picture with your waterproof camera, and decide that's enough or today. You can finish your adventure another day, and maybe even find out what the dolphin was trying to show you.

The End!
