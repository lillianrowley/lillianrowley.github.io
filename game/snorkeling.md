You follow the pink shimmering and start running out of breath. You notice that the shimmerings are pretty shallow and that you have a snorkel back home. So, you take a five minute break for a quick breath, and to go grab your snorkel.

You also notice that dolphin is still trying to get your attention. It can't be that the dolphin is just excitied to see a human. She wants to show *you* something.

Do you go home, follow the dolphin, or keep following the shimmers?
