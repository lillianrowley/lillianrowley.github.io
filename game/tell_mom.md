You go back home and tell your mom. You can see that she is a bit disappointed in you, but you know that you did the right thing. You shouldn't go places without telling your parents! 

She gives you a hug and says she was close to calling 911. You are happy you told her before you dove into the water of the beach at midnight. You expect that you can't finish this mystery today. It's midnight. Maybe tomorrow!

The End!
