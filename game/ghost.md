You follow the scary "ooooooooooh!" until you get to a room with a trap door, a closet, and some dirty clothes. 

You decide that dirty clothes are probably not where a ghost would hang out, and "oooooooooooh!" is the sound that a ghost makes. So, you decide that *if* there is a ghost, it is probably in the trap door or the closet.

Which do you open? Do you open one at all?
