You follow the shimmers and you think that you'll *never* catch them. You're not the best at swimming, so you get pretty tired pretty quickly.

Just as you think you can't handle it any more, the shimmers stop.

You're surprised to see that the shimmers aren't anything. They're just blurs of light in the water.

You are so far out into the ocean, that you think you should probably go back home. Do you keep following the light, or turn around and go home?
