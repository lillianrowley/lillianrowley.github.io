<p>The dolphin chirps at you a couple of times, then goes under the water.</p>

<p>You remember that you left your snorkel at the beach. After going back to get your snorkel, you swim out again and follow the dolphin.</p>

<p>It leads you to a shimmering underwater castle! But, you see a group of shimmers and flashes over in the other direction.</p>

<p>Which way do you go?</p>
