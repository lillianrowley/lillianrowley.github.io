---

You slowly creep over to the trap door, and open it with a long *creeeeeeeaaaaaak*

When you look inside, there is a big, dusty book. In the trap door, it's not a big room like you expected. Instead, it's just like a tiny cupboard. You decide that the book is probably important if it's stored in a trap door, instead of just a book shelf (there's one very close nearby).

You open it up and the first word is "Book." When you read the rest, it says:

"Book - This book is very important if you're going to meet a ghost. Ghosts hate ice cream. Ghosts love popcorn. Ghosts middley balloons. The End"

You decide that you should pack ice cream (in case it's a bad ghost), popcorn (in case it wants to be your friend), and maybe some balloons. So, you run home, ask your mom for some balloons, pop some corn, and go to Dairy Queen and get a chocolate cookie-dough Blizzard.

Then you run back to the haunted house, find the room, and open up the closet.

When you open the closet, you find a scary ghost!!! The scary ghost says "oooooooooooooh!"

You say "You are EEEEVIL!"

Then the ghost says "ooooooooooooohnooooooooooooooo!"

You say "I am sure that you are *eeeeeeeevilllllll*

The ghost says "ooooooooooooooohnooooooooooooo!"

You say "Are you talking like 'No, I'm not evil,' or are you talking like 'I want to play Uno'?"

"Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuunoooooooooooooo" said the ghost.

You say "Huh, well, this is a closet, we can probably find Uno somewhere"

So, you and the ghost look for *Uno* for five hours and six minutes and finally find it! Then, you play Uno for the rest of the night. The ghost is very good; You get beaten five times. You are very good; The ghost gets beaten six times.

**The End**
