The dolphin chirps at you a couple of times, then goes under the water.

You remember that you left your snorkel at the beach. After going back to get your snorkel, you swim out again and follow the dolphin.

It leads you to a shimmering underwater castle! But, you see a group of shimmers and flashes over in the other direction.

Which way do you go?
