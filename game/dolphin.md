The dolphin chirps at you a couple of times, then goes under the water.

You remember that you left your snorkel at the beach. After going back to get a quick breath and your snorkel, you swim out again and follow the dolphin.

It leads you to a shimmering underwater palace! But, you see a group of shimmers and flashes over in the other direction.

Which way do you go?
