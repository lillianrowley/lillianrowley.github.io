You can follow the shimmers later, but they are probably just the sun reflecting in the water, and the dolphin might actually get you to a *thing*. But, you also hear your mom calling. It's kind of hard to hear, since you are pretty deep in the water, but you hear *something*.

Do you go back up and check if it's your mom, or do you keep going?
