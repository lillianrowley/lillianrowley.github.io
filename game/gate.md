You walk forward and find that the gate was an illusion! You walk straight through it.

Behind the gate, you realize that the whole palace was an illusion. It's really a poorly-constructed city. The houses are made of caves with seaweed hanging in their doorways.

You explore the cave houses for a while, but nobody is there, so you eventually go back home for dinner.

The End!
