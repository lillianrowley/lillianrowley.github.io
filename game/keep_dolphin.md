title: Still Following the Dolphin
back: /game/follow_dolphin.html
---

You are about to follow the dolphin when you hear a "*Boop-boop!*" sound. You know that this means you have a message on your Relay (Ultimate Water-Proof Edition). So you go back up to the surface where you can press some button (*blip, blip*) and listen to your message.

When you get up to the surface and you listen to your message you hear it's your dad saying: "Time for dinner, kiddo!"

So, you go home and have your favorite dinner: *Tomato soup!*

The End!
