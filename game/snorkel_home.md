You go home and have a boring rest of the day, except for five minutes when you think about what the pink shimmers were and what the dolphin was trying to show you. Maybe you can find out another day, but it's 2 hours past your bedtime and you need to get some sleep if you are going to do that. Maybe you can do it tomorrow.

**The End**
