![A scary zombie!](/game/images/Zombie.jpg){: style="float:right"}

You hold your shoe like a sword, because you don't have any other idea of what to do. Suddenly, the zombie steps back!

He says: "Sh-sh-shoe!"

You feel bad for the zombie, and try to ask if you can help.

He asks "Friend...?"

You make friends with the zombie and party all night! You also meet a ghost and watch some movies together.

The End!
