You go back home and put away your snorkel. You grab a glass of water, take a sip, and take a deep breath before diving back into the water. As soon as you go in, you think of something, and you go back up. It's getting kind of late, and you forgot to tell your mom that you were going to the beach. She could be very worried, even though your house is only one block away from the beach.

Do you go back to tell you mom, or do you keep going?
