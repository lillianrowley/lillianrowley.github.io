The silly (or awkward) sledding competition is not just any competition - it's the silly sledding olympics! Many people don't know about this event, but it is a real thing, at least in my imagination. It really is quite simple if you know how to do sharp turns. Just do them too sharp! You tip over and it gets kind of funny. You can also use these little tips: Go backward, or turn the sled upside-down. You can even try flailing around your arms and legs while yelling "Go Dasher! Go Dancer! Go all the raindeer! GO! GO! GO!" ... if you like. It *does* seem a little Christmassy though, but I guess all sledding is Chistmassy. I don't know, you can do whatever you like as long as it's silly.
